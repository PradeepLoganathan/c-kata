# Explanation

1. **Include headers:** stdio.h for input/output and stdbool.h for Boolean variables.

2. **Variables:** The code declares variables of the following types:
    - ```int``` for whole numbers
    - ```float``` for single-precision floating-point numbers
    - ```double``` for double-precision floating-point numbers
    - ```char``` for single characters
    - ```bool``` for Boolean values (true or false)
    - ```String``` Variable: In C, strings are arrays of characters ending with a null character '\0'. We use a character array to store the string.
    - ```sizeof``` Operator: This operator returns the size of a variable or data type, in bytes. It helps understand how much memory different types consume.

3. **printf() Statements:** Each printf statement neatly explains the data type and displays the corresponding variable's value. Notice the use of format specifiers (%d, %f, %lf, %c, %s) to correctly display different types.

# Compiling and Running the Program

 - Follow the same steps as before to compile and run this program in your environment.

 - Save the code in a file named data_types.c.
 - Compile the program using GCC: ```gcc data_types.c -o data_types```.
 - Run the program: ```./data_types```.
